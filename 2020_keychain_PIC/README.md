# Design Files for the 2020 Electrical Tutorials

## Steps:
1. Create new KICAD Project
2. Open schematic -> library editor, create a new library.
3. create a new symbol in that library
4. draw the symbol based on the datasheet (Using the L vaiant):
https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/PIC16-L-F15313_23-Data-Sheet-40001897B.pdf
  1. place a rectangle, it is ok if the size isn't perfect, you can adjust it later
  2. hover over the edge of the rectangle and press e to edit the properties, select fill background
  3. place pins based on data sheet. it is best to place them grouped together by purpose, but in order like on the datasheet is good for this.
  4. If you need to move anything around you can hover over it and hit m to move it. To adjust the size of the rectangle you can use g for grab.
5. save the new symbol and exit the symbol editor
6. add the new PIC16LF15313 symbol to the shcematic
7. place the rest of the parts
8. add connections
9. anotate schematic
